The answer is ``node-cron``(nodejs) or cron jobs(in general), which are time based schedulers to execute tasks and npm module called ``open`` to open yea literally open files, images or browsers.

Keep in mind the timings are suitable to my needs so whats happening in the script is there's a scheduler which will fire up the time is either ``11am 5min`` or ``23pm 5min``.

Adding more to this, the script runs at the system startup so I don't have to wrorry about running it every time
