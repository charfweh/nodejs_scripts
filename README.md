# the damn vote
starting web browser to vote the damn bot in morning and night
### How does it work?
The answer is ``node-cron``(nodejs) or cron jobs(in general), which are time based schedulers to execute tasks and npm module called ``open`` to open yea literally open files, images or browsers.

Keep in mind the timings are suitable to my needs so whats happening in the script is there's a scheduler which will fire up the time is either ``11am 5min`` or ``23pm 5min``.

### Setup
- Get em modules listed in [Quick Links](https://github.com/charfweh/nodejs_scripts#quick-links)
- Clone or copy the code do whatever you want
- Type in ``forever start the_damn_bot.js`` and thats pretty much it ;)
