Adding more to this, using ``crontab``, the script runs at system startup so I don't have to wrorry about running it every time when I fire up the system
##### Setup
- Get em modules listed in ``Quick Links``
- Clone or copy the code do whatever you want

- Run them

### :small_red_triangle: is_this_a_rickroll.py
