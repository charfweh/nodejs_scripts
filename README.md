### How does it work?
The answer is ``node-cron``(nodejs) or cron jobs(in general), which are time based schedulers to execute tasks and npm module called ``open`` to open yea literally open files, images or browsers.
Keep in mind the timings are suitable to my needs so whats happening in the script is there's a scheduler which will fire up the time is either ``11am 5min`` or ``23pm 5min``.
